This script will automatically download all of the fanart for every TV show (thetvdb.com) and movie (themoviedb.org) in your XBMC library and place it in an 'extrafanart' directory to be used by skins which support this feature.

The script can now be downloaded from the official repo for eden-pre.

To run the script in bulk mode simply click on it in the 'Addons' or 'Programs' menu in XBMC.  You can change the settings if you wish in the addon settings page.

If you wish to run the script in solo mode you can do so by calling the script with 2 arguments, the first must be either 'movie' or 'tvshow' and the second should be the name of the movie or show, e.g.

XBMC.runscript(script.extrafanartdownloader, tvshow, House)

or

XBMC.runscript(script.extrafanartdownloader, movie, 50 First Dates)
